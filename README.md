<h1 align="center"> Godo Knight </h1>  



## Why i started this project  

i wanted to try another game engine to challenge myself and learn a new thing and try to make a game with it  
and see if i can use what i learned from unity or in general, or i need a completely different view  
also i guess its cool to see how different engines work and solve different problems and what features they offer.

i will also try to make all assets like character models and animations to practice 2d art.
